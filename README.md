# NAF

This is NAF. Or, Natural Advice Fitness. Meant to advocate for natural bodybuilding, and being comfortable within your own skin. Many people suffer from body dysmorphia and I am to counter that by making people know that everyone is unique and that no one should be ashamed as there is no shame in being weak, only staying weak.
 
## Design Process
 
I based the design off other fitness websites and used colour theory to inspire action. It's meant to be for both active gym goers and beginners who plan to begin their transformatinos.
